Requires Winpython or a compatible Python distribution. Basic Python runtime is not sufficient.

Ex.:

Download this repository and extract to any folder.  
Recomended (Windows):  
`%APPDATA%\zip_check`  
Ex. (Windows):  
`C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\zip_check`
## 📑 usage - Windows
Once both Winpython and the app are setup, double click the zip_check.py file to start.  
If file associations with .py files is not working, double click the .cmd file that will try to autodetect the winpython folder.
